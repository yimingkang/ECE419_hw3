Introduction
============
This assignment implements a distributed peer-to-peer system of the game.
In particular, it mimics the environment of high network bandwidth, very
low parallelism in network, very low network latency, low-end nodes. It passes
a Token Ring around each node and every client attaches its own event to the
token and pass it around. The missile projectile update inconcistency is solved
by adding a new UPDATE_PROJECTILE event and each client is responsible to update
its own missile.
